## Intro

Personal site built using Gatsby and the [Dimension theme](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension).

## Site History

This is the current version of [my](https://github.com/mikachan/) personal site, [sekai.co.uk](https://sekai.co.uk). The first version was built in 2003 as a WordPress site, and throughout the years has been used as my web development playground, starting with custom WP themes and plugins. Around 2014 I started using it as a way to practice React, which is how I eventually ended up using Gatsby.

## Development
To run the site in development mode with a local dev server, run the following command:

``` shell
npm start
```

To commit, use:

``` shell
npm run cz
```
